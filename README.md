# Facebook Ads Data Vizualiztion (Python)
Working with statistics on the progress of Facebook advertising campaigns.


1. Grouping of data by days for 2021 has been performed.
The total amount of advertising expenses in 2021 is plotted.
Daily ROMI in 2021 is plotted.

2. Grouping of data by campaign name is done.
A graph of the total amount of advertising costs in each of the campaigns is plotted.
The total ROMI in each of the campaigns is plotted.
3. Constructed a box plot to determine the spread of daily ROMI in each campaign.

4. A histogram with the distribution of ROMI values ​​from the file facebook_ads_data.csv is constructed.

5. A heat map of the correlation between all numerical indicators in the facebook_ads_data.csv table was built. The indicators with the highest and lowest correlation were determined. 
6. Constructed a dot plot with linear regression using the lmplot() function, based on the data from "total_spend" and "total_value" to visualize the relationship between these values.
